# Moving_Entities_Map
## Overview

This code simulates a 10x10 grid with dynamic entities that interact based on their types, serving as a hands-on exercise to explore C++ fundamentals. It emphasizes the use of object-oriented programming (inheritance, polymorphism), dynamic memory management, and interactive user input, providing practical experience with key concepts like entity behaviors, randomization, and terminal-based applications. The primary goal is to strengthen foundational C++ skills while applying them in a structured and engaging project.

# A user-friendly terminal-based menu with options to:
- Display the current grid state.
- Move all animated entities.
- Query entity information by grid coordinates.
- Reset the grid and reinitialize the simulation.
- Exit the program.
